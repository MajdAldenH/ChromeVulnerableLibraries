# Impirical Study of Using Vulnerable Libraries in the Architecture of
Chrome

##We implemented a model that runs on the Chromium
project to make sure the vulnerability libraries that are defined
in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) contain
the correct description. By choosing different Chrome versions,
we used the tool mentioned to check any vulnerability
in the database. We get the XML files that contain a list
of vulnerabilities. Then, we determine whether a library has
vulnerabilities or not.
We selected Google Chrome as the project to be studied
because it is one of the most popular OSS. Also, there are
plenty of resources available such as design documents,
architecture overviews, testing information that can be
facilitated through its official platform.
